### Hello, I'm Min! 

I've grown up my entire childhood to early adulthood with an immense love for computers and technology. From my time working as a professional animator, I learned that I have a high aptitude for expressing my creativity and tenacious problem-solving which made me want to pursue a career in Software Development. The satiation from successfully overcoming technical hurdles and seeing my efforts come to fruition are personal motivators that keep my passion for coding alive! Welcome to my GitHub where I've showcased all of the projects that I've worked on! 

Most of my projects showcase my proficiency in JavaScript, Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. I've worked on two solo personal projects where I showcase those skills as well as a group project with 3 other developers where we exercised not only our technical know-how, but also the ability to work cohesively in a group setting. These projects tackle the multitude of moving parts that is a full-stack application, and delineate a high-level of understanding of how backend and frontend development are woven together to ultimately enrich a user's experience.
